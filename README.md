This program is a practical part of my thesis titled "**Procedural creation of corridor networks in video games**".

My thesis aims to study and describe existing methods used in procedural generation (especially for creating corridor networks) and propose a new approach to the problem. The effect of the work is a computer program made in Unity that lets its user generate a 3D corridor network based on one of the following maze generation algorithms: Prim’s algorithm, Kruskal’s algorithm, Wilson’s algorithm, recursive backtracker, and hunt and kill algorithm. Additionally, the appearance of the created structure can be adjusted by changing the value of the provided parameters. These are: size, coordinates of start and finish points, number of main paths, branches length, and placement of additional rooms.
