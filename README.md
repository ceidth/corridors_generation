## General info
This program is a practical part of my thesis titled ** Procedural creation of corridor networks in video games **

My thesis aims to study and describe existing methods used in procedural generation (especially for creating corridor networks) and propose a new approach to the problem. The effect of the work is a computer
program made in Unity that lets its user generate a 3D corridor network based on one of the following maze generation algorithms: Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, Wilson's algorithm, recursive backtracker,
and hunt and kill algorithm.
Additionally, the appearance of the created structure can be adjusted by changing the value of the provided parameters. These are: size, coordinates of start and finish points, number of main paths, branches
length, and placement of additional rooms.

## Getting started
This Unity Project was made using a 2021.3.11f1 editor version. The Unity Editor is required to run it. Download it from [unity](https://unity.com/download).

First action after starting the program is choosing the algorithm. As mentioned above, user can choose one of the following maze generation algorithms: Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, Wilson's algorithm, recursive backtracker or hunt and kill algorithm.

</p>

After choosing the algorithm, a parameter menu is being displayed on the right side of the screen. Number of available parameters depends on the chosed algorithm.
